A small operating system implementing fundamental memory management techniques, including paging, dynamic allocation, and memory protection. It ensures process isolation using access control mechanisms and employs locks to prevent race conditions in shared memory access.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Memory Management: Paging, dynamic allocation, and page tables
Memory Protection: Process isolation and access control
Concurrency Control: Locks for safe shared memory access
Basic Scheduler: Manages process execution
ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Programming Language: C
OS Concepts: Memory management, concurrency, scheduling
ðŸ“Œ Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my understanding of low-level system operations, secure memory handling, and concurrency control in an OS environment.

Feel free to contribute or explore the code! ðŸš€
